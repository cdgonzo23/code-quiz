# Code Quiz

## Descripton

The code quiz challenge is a ten question timed quiz about various different states capitals. It is multiple choice and displays the high scores at the very end. You have 30 seconds to answer these questions and if you get one wrong, 5 seconds are deducted from the timer.

The goal of this project was to design the webpage from scratch and add the functionality of switching through the start page, question pages, end page, and high scores page. Each page had to have specific functionality which was almost always created by an event listener. I had to create various different functions and link those functions to event listeners so the whole webpage worked properly with no errors. I attempted to make the JavaScript as efficient as possible with creating functions that would apply to multiple of the same thing. 

In this project I learned the importance of planning from the beginning, I believe that I culd have done this using way less code than I have right now if I started off with a better plan. I also learned about local storage and utilizing to display certain things like the users personal highscore. I gained a better understaing of indexing and moving from section to section without jumping through for loops. I learned how functions can be modular and used to make less lines of code.
